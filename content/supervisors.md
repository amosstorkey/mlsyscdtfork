The School of Informatics and the University of Edinburgh has a long and prestigious history in both Artificial Intelligence and Computer Systems. It has a concentration of research across AI applications such as natural language, vision, robotics, and medicine. This CDT will be strongly collaborative, bringing people together across the whole ML-Systems Stack. We expect each student to have a supervisor from the more ML side and a supervisor from the more Systems side (potentially with other supervisors).

## Directors

-  [Amos Storkey](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/amos/)
-  [Ajitha Rajan](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/arajan/)
-  [Luo Mai](https://luomai.github.io/)
-  [Michael O’Boyle](https://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/home/mob/)

The CDT Directors are all potential supervisors on the CDT.

## Supervisors

A more comprehensive list of people who are potential supervisors is listed here, under a variety of categories. This is by no means exhaustive. If you are not sure of the right supervisor for you, it is possible to apply without naming a supervisor. If you have discussed things with a potential supervisor, then please make that clear in your application. Some projects will be done with CDT Partners. They are also listed below.
