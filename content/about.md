# Project Summary

- Machine Learning (ML) and AI dramatically impact our daily lives. But ML performance depends on the systems that implements it. Systems research and ML research are symbiotic.
- This Centre for Doctoral Training pulls researchers together. They will work across the full machine learning-systems stack. 
- The Centre cares about the problems to be solved and the how the methods help people. It will research how to jointly develop the right methods and the right ways to deploy things to make ML work for real problems. 
- The School of Informatics and the University of Edinburgh has a long and prestigious history in both Artificial Intelligence and Computer Systems. It has a concentration of research across AI applications such as natural language, vision, robotics, and medicine.
- The Centre will pioneer research for efficient, effective, deployable AI that benefits people.
